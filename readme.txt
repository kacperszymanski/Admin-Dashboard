Project Description:
The project is a simple web application for an admin dashboard web page. The page includes a header section with a search bar, user profile and theme toggle button, and some buttons to perform different actions. The sidebar section includes a logo and links to different sections of the dashboard. The main content section includes three sections that display projects, announcements, and trending topics.

Usage:
To use the application, simply click the "Toggle Theme" button in the upper right corner of the page. This will switch the theme from light to dark or vice versa.

Files:
The project includes three files: index.html, style.css, and script.js. The HTML file contains the structure of the page, the CSS file contains the styles for the page, and the JavaScript file contains the code that toggles the theme.
